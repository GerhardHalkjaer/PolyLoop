# ‚ôªÔ∏è PolyLoop Packaging Assist

A Blazor Server application designed to assist with plastic packaging classification and labeling in an industrial or recycling setting.

## üìñ Description

PolyLoop Packaging Assist is a web-based tool that guides users through creating a new plastic packaging record. Users select the general plastic type, the specific subtype, and the packaging form. The system then uses two cameras:
- One captures the **weight display**, which is read using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- The other captures an **image of the plastic item**, which is uploaded to OneDrive as proof.

Once recorded, the system prints a label containing a **QR code** with the ID, plastic type, and weight. All data is also saved to a database and can be reviewed from a list view.

## üöÄ Features

- Guided multi-step packaging creation process
- Plastic type, subtype, and packaging type selection
- Camera integration:
  - OCR from weight scale image
  - Photo proof storage to OneDrive
- Label printing with QR code
- Data persistence to database
- Record viewing through UI list

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- .NET 8
- Blazor Server
- Azure OneDrive API
- OCR library (e.g., Tesseract or IronOCR)
- QR Code generation (e.g., QRCoder)
- Brother QL-820NWB printer integration
- SQL Server / SQLite
- JaveScript

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 8.x
- Visual Studio 2022+
- Camera support on local device or connected hardware
- SQL Server (or your configured DB)
- Brother QL-820NWB printer driver
- OneDrive credentials for image storage

### TODO
- OCR module needs to be installed.
- Images on package List isnt being showed.
- Remake so the pages works on android tablets.
- add so packeges can be marked as shipped so the list isnt showing them, and make another list that shows shipped so that they can see what they have standing and what has been shipped.

### System Order
- Production uses Services to communicate with the PolyLoopApi.
- Services uses DataAccess to communicate with the DB
- DataAccess communicate with the DB
- Managment currently isnt used.
-they all know uses Entities 
 
### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GerhardHalkjaer/PolyLoop.git
