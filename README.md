# ‚ôªÔ∏è PolyLoop Packaging Assist

A Blazor Server application designed to assist with plastic packaging classification and labeling in an industrial or recycling setting.

## üìñ Description

PolyLoop Packaging Assist is a web-based tool that guides users through creating a new plastic packaging record. Users select the general plastic type, the specific subtype, and the packaging form. The system then uses two cameras:
- One captures the **weight display**, which is read using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- The other captures an **image of the plastic item**, which is uploaded to OneDrive as proof.

Once recorded, the system prints a label containing a **QR code** with the ID, plastic type, and weight. All data is also saved to a database and can be reviewed from a list view.

## üöÄ Features
